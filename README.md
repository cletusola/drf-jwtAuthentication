# Jwt Authentication 
<h3>user auth with django rest framework and react js using django rest_framework_simple_jwt.</h3>

<h4>DIRS:</h4>
<p>COntains "backend" and "frontend folder"</p>
<p>Backend folder contains the backend code</p>
<p>Frontend folder contains the frontend code</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>clone: git clone drf-jwtAuthentication.git</p>
<p>create virtual env: i.e python3 -m venv env</p>
<p>install required libraries: pip intall -r requirements.txt</p> 

<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>This project is focused on just jwt authentication with django_rest_framework and react js and nothing more</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p> username will be included in the tokens generated by simplejwt, this is to make it easier to get the user's username in frontend after the token is being decoded</p>
<p> tokens are stored in local storage after signing in via the fronend interface, and they are deleted after signing out</p>
